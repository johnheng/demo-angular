# DemoAngular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.5.0. The point of this project was to teach myself Angular. I converted an old webpage ([carinaiseverythingto.me](carinaiseverythingto.me)) that was using jQuery and some libraries to use Angular 2 instead. Everything was turned into a component and data was pulled in from a json via `http.get` request.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
